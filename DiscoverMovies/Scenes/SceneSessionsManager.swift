// We need to let each scene describe their capabilities, what kind of content they can work with.

// What are my activation conditions
// The app has two different type of windows:
// - A primary scene which should be able to handle anything
// - A secondary scene which only shows the details of a movie.

// Scenario 1:
// There is only on scene open which is a secondary scene.
// When only the secondayr scene is open it means the user can't do anything without opening a new primary window.
// In the advent where that user needs to open a push notification, deeplink from another app, or application shortcut item
// We need to make sure the secondary scene has a predicate that indicates that it cant do anything except things related to that movie.
// Which in our case is nothing. Therefore the system should decide to open up a new window

// There is multiple windows open but only one is primary
// Same thing should happen, only the primary scene should be able to handle the action.

// There are multiple primary scenes open.
// Let the system choose one based on which primary scene fulfills the most requirements.
